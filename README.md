# Informed-sample

This is a pared-down version of *INFORMED*, a **news aggregator web app** that I built using **React.js**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**. The **web app** queries **The New York Times API** and **The Guardian API** and curates news articles according to the user's interests.

**FUNCTIONALITIES & PAGE INTERACTIVITY**

## These coding segments implement:
- Querying The New York Times API and The Guardian API. The user can input a date and a search string.
- Fetching relevant articles from the API's, and 
- Outputting a list of articles that match the user's search.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

To run the applictation in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In order for the web app to work, you must **register for an account** on **The New York Times Dev Portal** (https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) and on **The Guardian Open Platform** (https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/). Once you have registered and have your **personal API keys**, paste your keys in the src/config.js file and make sure that that file is listed in the .gitignore file.
